This script takes advantage of creating a server from an archive.
It takes 2 arguments by default first one is the download link and second one is the action with it. The arguments are case sensitive.
The list of possible second arguments:
1.	-c This sets the script so it installs the downloaded archive and creates a server from it. This needs 2 additional arguments where the first one should be the name of the new server and the second one should be your username. The username can not be root.
2.	-d This sets the script so it only downloads the archive. This does not need any additional arguments.

Please be sure that the download link is correct and it points to the archive you want to download. So far it can only handle .zip extensions but I will add more if needed.
