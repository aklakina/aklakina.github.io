This script handles the data.txt for you.
It has argument configuration where:
-no arguments lists all the items of the data.txt
-first argument should be a name of an already existing server (which by itself gives back if it is a part of the table or not)
-second should be add or remove to add the server to the table or delete it from it respectively.
Remove argument needs a confirmation which could be given by a force argument in the 4th place which should be y or Y.
