This script schedules a restart when it detects change on a have-to-restart-to-make-it-real server file.

If you change anything in the server.properties then this script checks for the default_timer.txt for time. You can give it as hh:mm 24-hour format or seconds.

If everybody leaves the server the script will restart it automatically.

Child-script:
-Timer:
   This script starts the countdown for the restart.
