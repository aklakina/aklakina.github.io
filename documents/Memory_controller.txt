This script checks the server processes and the actual memory usage compared to the max memory given in the webui's java arguments.

If it hits 93% (it is configurable in the script by editing the line let "max_mem=$max_mem1*93/100" with changing the 93), then it writes out a 2 minutes countdown. After the 2 minutes countdown it restarts the server.
