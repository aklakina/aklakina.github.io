This is a script that automates your port distribution (randomly generates a port for each server in the range of 25500 and 25600) and after that sets your iptable config to do not drop any connection on that port. It logs everything.

Child-script:
-ports:
   This script with no argument writes out all of the servers with their assigned ports.
   With -c argument as first it refreshes the database.
